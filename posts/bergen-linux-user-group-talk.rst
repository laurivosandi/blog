Talk at Bergen Linux User Group about FLOSS in Estonia
======================================================

I am travelling in the end of November to check out Bergen and it's open-source
community. I was suggested to sort of redeem my accommodation by giving
a talk at Bergen Linux User Group meeting on 20th of November 19:00.

Here's proposed topic list:

* Little background of who am I and few bits about major projects in works:
  Migrating five educational organizations of Tallinn to Ubuntu and associated challenges;
  Terminal-server project based on Chinese ARM boards;
  DevOps curriculum '15 at Estonian IT College
* What is Estonian e-residence and what you can do with it:
  ID-card, digi-ID, mobile-ID;
  overview of e-services provided by the government;
  overview of private sector e-services;
  register a LLC in 20 minutes;
  e-financials;
  e-customs;
  e-elections
* Status quo of open-source projects and NGO-s in Estonia: Estobuntu
* My not so dystopic vision for the future of e-Estonia
