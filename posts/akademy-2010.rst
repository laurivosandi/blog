Akademy 2010
============

Friday afternoon me and `Estobuntu <http://estobuntu.org/>`_  guys started
driving from Tallinn towards Tampere. Unfortunately we didn't have amphibious
vehicle at our disposal so we had to take a boat to cross Gulf of Finland.
We arrived here around 9pm - luckily there was some free beer left!

Now the first day of `Akademy 2010 <http://akademy.kde.org/>`_  conference is
slowly coming to an end. There has been dozens interesting and useful lectures.
Several Free Software projects are represented - KDE, Maemo, MeeGo, Qt and so on.
Salmon for lunch was great, altough it could have been free!

`Flickr photo stream <http://www.flickr.com/groups/akademy2010/>`_  has great
pictures of the event. In the evening there is going to be a party - hopefully
with free beer!

On monday I took a test and I passed it - I am now `Nokia Certified Qt Developer

All the conference attendees could have it for free.
