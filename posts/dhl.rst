Because f*ck you DHL
====================

Introduction
------------

I am Estonian guy currently living in Berlin.
I have registered a company in Estonia.
In January I had placed order for 3 Cubietrucks from China to be shipped to Berlin
and I had the invoice addressed to my company back in Estonia.

I knew I had to deal with customs as I had some experience working with
Estonian DHL who quickly and rather painlessly got it done for another package
from Aliexpress I ordered two-three months earlier.

Playing ping-pong with DHL
--------------------------

On the 1st of February I received an obscure SMS from an UK telephone number
telling the tracking number of **some** package and
a generic e-mail address to contact regarding customs:

.. code::

    Guten Tag, der Zoll fordert einen Zahlungsnachweis für Ihre Sendung
    AWB 1118xxxxxx. Bitte sender Sie uns diesen an lejhubcustoms@dhl.com oder
    rufen Sie uns an unter 0341/44994466. Vielen Dank. Ihr DHL Express Team
    
I also had a converation with a guy who called me from a German number.
I asked whether it is about package from China, but he refused to share the details.
How the hell am I supposed to know what you're talking about if I have ordered
packages from several companies across the globe?

He instructed me to send the tracking number, EORI number and company contacts
to the generic e-mail.
After that I received the generic response and I kept receiving those for
**each** **e-mail** I sent them. Until now I have 8 of those in my mailbox:

.. code::

    Sehr geehrte Damen und Herren,
    vielen Dank für Ihre E-Mail. Ihre Anfrage wird unverzüglich bearbeitet.
     
     
    Dear Sir or Madam,
    Thank you for your e-mail. Your request will be processed immediately.

The first response from **Madeleine** instructed me to send the tracking number
altough I **already** had **sent** **the** **tracking** **number**:

.. code::

    Dear customer,

    please send us the tracking number.

    Mit freundlichen Grüßen / Kind Regards

    Madeleine

The next response by **Kai** who addressed me as Miss Võsandi said following:

.. code::

    Dear Ms Võsandi

    Thank you for your email.
    To customs clear your shipment please also send us your VAT no. via email.
    Thank you!


    Mit freundlichen Grüßen / Kind Regards


    Kai

I replied that my company does not have VAT number since it is not required
for small companies with income lower than certain threshold.
That is what I also said over the phone.

Then there were no e-mails for two-three days, I sent e-mail to the generic
address asking about the status of the package. **Gloria** responded with:

.. code::

    Dear Customer,

    thank you for your Email. I checked your shipment.
    For customs clearance we need a Importer.
    You informed us that the importer will be your company in Estonia.
    To get a shipment cleared for a company which is not in Germany a DDP confirmation from the shipper is needed.

    This means the shipper needs to confirm that they will pay the importcharges.
    This is the only way to handle this shipment and get it cleared by customs and delivered.

    We contacted the shipper about this and wait for the response now.
    
    Mit freundlichen Grüßen /Kind Regards

    Gloria
    
I am not a of course bookkeeper and I don't know the details about importing stuff to EU.
I would expect the company that is in this particular business field to 
have professional knowledge about taxation and importing.
In December I dealt with Estonian DHL about another package from
China. I paid 20% VAT of the product value for entering the EU tax zone,
14EUR for customs taxes and 23EUR for the paperwork.

According to this e-mail the DHL is doing business with Chinese companies for the
first time.
Chinese have never cared about the EU taxes unless it is clearly stated otherwise,
eg. *Customs services and international tracking provided* in eBay.

I sent them several e-mails saying that most probably I have to pay the import fees.
They insisted I have to wait for the confirmation from shipper.

Then at some point, out of the blue they tell me that I can pay in cash to the delivery guy for the customs.
In the beginning when I got the call from the guy I explicitly asked can I pay
for all the fees in cash to the delivery guy, they said that for all payments 
they will send an invoice, thus what the hell?

.. code::

    Dear customer,
     
    if we use a non-german EORI number for import we need a confirmation from
    shipper to pay duties and taxes. If you want you also can confirm a delivery by cash.
     
    Kind regards
     
    Sylvio

Then some letters later they **finally** tell me to send the invoice from
the shipper so they could declare the goods.

.. code::


    Dear Mr. Vosandi,
     
    i cant tell u an ammount of duties and taxes because we need a proof of
    payment for the duty department, if we have it we can tell u the ammount.
    We cant deliver without this proof of payment, please send us some invoice
    or order confirmation to clear the shipment for delivery.
     
    Mit freundlichen Grüßen / Kind Regards

    Kai
    
Next thing happening is that the delivery guy calls that he's about to deliver
the package. I was about to sign the delivery and I ask him what about the
import declaration and he just shrugs his shoulders saying that he doesn't know.
Eventually I did get no customs declaration and I haven't heard from DHL since then.

I can't believe I am the only company importing goods to European Union.
Why do I have do deal with this crap via e-mail? A generic e-mail?!
Why there is no web environment for customs declaration and
uploading the related documents?
Up to now I have sent and received in total 23 e-mails and
talked to 5-6 persons related to this package
which shows utter incompetence of the German DHL.

Some customer feedback
----------------------

Now we finally come to the customer feedback, the most important aspect of 
glorious capitalism.

Dear DHL, please fire some of those incompetent employees and
spend this  money to develop a proper web interface for declaring customs.
Bind that system with the tracking number system so the customer or the shipper could
already upload all the required documents **before** the package arrives in
the destination.
This way you can get rid of the warehousing and increase your throughput and
thus efficiency.

Once you have web based forms make it crystal clear what kind of information
needs to be entered.
Make it possible to create an account so I will **never-ever** have to enter
that data again.
Get rid of the retarded generic e-mail approach as it is slow, error-prone and
inefficient.

Following clip from Eurotrip pretty accurately describes my feelings for
German bureaucracy:
