Let's study zie German
======================

A common misconception people have is that all people in Russia and surrounding
countries speak Russian natively. 
Frist of all, Estonian language belongs to Finno-Urgic language family.
Finnish is most closely related to Estonian as it sounds very similar and
many words are shared among the languages. Hungarian also belongs to
Finno-Ugric language family altough Hungarian does not sound much like Finnish,
it has more to do with the structure of language, mainly the excess of cases.

Estonian is among one of the most complex languages because of 
`14 cases <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estonian_grammar>`_.
In English you would use prepositions:
*about*, *into*, *in*, *from*, *onto*, *on*, *into*, *up* *to*, *as*, *without*,
*with* whereas in Estonian you modify the word itself,
so in case of the word *raamat*, which means book in Estonian,
you would form the same meaning by adding a suffix:
*raamatust*, *raamatusse*, *raamatus*, *raamatusse*,
*raamatule*, *raamatul*, *raamatult*, *raamatuni*, *raamatuna*,
*raamatuta*, *raamatuga* etc.

Numbers
-------

I like math, so let's start with numbers.
In Estonian the first natural numbers go like this:
*üks*, *kaks*, *kolm*, *neli*, *viis*, *kuus*, *seitse*, *kaheksa*,
*üheksa*, *kümme*.

In Finnish it's very similar, just substitute *ü* of the Estonian alphabet with Finnish *y*:
*yksi*, *kaksi*, *kolme*, *neljä*, *viisi*, *kuusi*, *seitsemän*,
*kahdeksan*, *ühdeksän*, *kümmenen*.
Incidently the *y* and *ü* are pronounced like German *ü*.

Now you may compare it to Russian and see Estonian has not much to do with it:
*odin*, *dva*, *tri*, *chetyre*, *pyat*, *schest*, *sem*, *vosem*, *devyat*,
*desjat*.

Words of Greek origin
---------------------

Of course much of the scientific vocabulary is from Greek.
Xenophon Zolotas, a Greek economist wrote a speech in 1959 where
basically every word is of Greek origin, most of the Greek scientific
vocabulary has been adapted for Estonian aswell:

    Kyrie, it is Zeus' anathema on our epoch for the dynamism of our economies
    and the heresy of our economic methods and policies that we should agonize
    the Scylla of numismatic plethora and the Charybdis of economic anaemia. It
    is not my idiosyncrasy to be ironic or sarcastic, but my diagnosis would be
    that politicians are rather cryptoplethorists. Although they emphatically
    stigmatize numismatic plethora, they energize it through their tactics and
    practices. Our policies have to be based more on economic and less on
    political criteria. Our gnomon has to be a metron between political,
    strategic and philanthropic scopes. Political magic has always been anti-
    economic. In an epoch characterized by monopolies, oligopolies, monopsonies,
    monopolistic antagonism and polymorphous inelasticities, our policies have
    to be more orthological. But this should not be metamorphosed into
    plethorophobia, which is endemic among academic economists. Numismatic
    symmetry should not hyper-antagonize economic acme. A greater harmonization
    between the practices of the economic and numismatic archons is basic.
    Parallel to this, we have to synchronize and harmonize more and more our
    economic and numismatic policies panethnically. These scopes are more
    practicable now, when the prognostics of the political and economic
    barometer are halcyonic. The history of our didymus organizations in this
    sphere has been didactic and their gnostic practices will always be a tonic
    to the polyonymous and idiomorphous ethnical economies. The genesis of the
    programmed organization will dynamize these policies. Therefore, I
    sympathize, although not without criticism on one or two themes, with the
    apostles and the hierarchy of our organs in their zeal to program orthodox
    economic and numismatic policies, although I have some logomachy with them. I
    apologize for having tyrannized you with my Hellenic phraseology. In my
    epilogue, I emphasize my eulogy to the philoxenous autochthons of this
    cosmopolitan metropolis and my encomium to you, Kyrie, and the stenographers.
