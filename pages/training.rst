Over the years I've conducted various training sessions with
amazingly positive feedback.
Currently I am ready to talk about following topics on a professional level:

* Python for beginners
* Python for advanced users
* `Setting up local area network using open-source tools <lan/>`_
* Firewalling using netfilter and iptables
* Virtual private networks using OpenVPN
* `Arduino </arduino/>`_ and electronics for beginners
* `Relational databases for beginners </rdbms/>`_

Don't hesitate to give me a call if you're interested in improving
the skillset of your company's employees.
The trainings are available in both Estonian and English.
