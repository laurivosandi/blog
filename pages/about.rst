About me
========

I am Lauri, an open-source geek from Estonia.
In my blog I occasionally write about Free, Libre and Open-Source software,
embedded computers, electronics, cryptography, security and privacy.
I am currently pursuing my Master studies of Embedded Systems at
EIT ICT Labs Master School [#master-school]_
and I am planning to continue as lecturer at Estonian IT College in 2015.

Over the past years I've been speaking at various events and lecturing
on different subjects [#past-events]_.
There is a growing list of videos featuring me talking about
education and the importance of open-source culture within education [#videos]_.

Some day I'll add here more bits and pieces :)
