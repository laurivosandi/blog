Hi!
===

On the top you can find links to:

* `Blog posts </posts.html>`_ about Free, Libre and Open-Source Software.
* `Trainings and course materials <training.html>`_ I've been working on in collaboration with Estonian IT College.
* `Products and services </products.html>`_ that I am offering.
* Few words `about me </about.html>`_.
* If you stumbled on this website by accident perhaps you can find an interesting topic to read about on the right ;)

This blog is powered by homemade Python code highly influenced by
`Sphinx <http://sphinx-doc.org/>`_, `Nikola <http://getnikola.com/>`_ and
probably other static HTML rendering engines.
There were several features that I were looking for and could not find in any existing project:
content hosted in Github, link validation, referred content caching,
embedding SVG-s, mobile first,
automated keyword extraction, related post derivation,
in-browser search etc.

I'd like to thank following great projects for making it happen:

* `reStructuredText <http://docutils.sourceforge.net/rst.html>`_ via docutils for markup;
* `Mathjax <http://www.mathjax.org/>`_ to render mathematical formulas written in LaTeX;
* `iconmonstr <http://iconmonstr.com/>`_ icons;
* `Disqus <https://disqus.com/>`_ for comments;
* `Fritzing <http://fritzing.org/home/>`_ for schematics;
* `Dia <http://dia-installer.de/shapes/cisconetwork/>`_ for network topology diagrams;
* `pygal <http://pygal.org/>`_ for charts;
* `Inkscape <http://www.inkscape.org/>`_ for other images;
* `nginx <http://nginx.org/>`_ for serving the content and
* `Debian <https://www.debian.org/>`_ for running the web-server
