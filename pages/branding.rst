Introducing Koodur OÜ
=====================

In July of 2013 I registered a limited liability company called Koodur in Estonia.
The company was founded for practical reasons to have a legal entity through
which I could communicate with my customers.

Most commercially available software is distributed in binary-only form and
is usually not updated frequently. It's like a preservative filled jar of jam.
Open-source software is  constantly evolving and adapting to technology
that is available today.
Considering also the relevations about NSA and other spying organizations
I firmly believe that open-source is a prerequisite of secure computing.

This also wraps up what I've been doing past years.
Learning and teaching about open-source tools that are available and
coming up with open-source solutions for various organizations.
I've been assisting various start-ups in the adoption of open-source tools.
For example the National Library of Estonia is running customized
Ubuntu 12.04 terminal-server setup with around 30 VXL thin-clients.
They're currently running the third iteration of the software patches I provided
to make the national ID-card work in their environment and
transitioning to diskless workstations right now.
